# Last Minute Skillet

http://theminuteskillet.surge.sh/ - Hosted by Surge.sh, Web Publishing for Developers. 

## About
The Last Minute Skillet was developed to help busy hungry people find a meal in a minute. Users can search for ingrediants, look and read about the different categories of food available, or have a random meal given to them.

## Technology
My first project, I've used HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript to build out the website. To have different recipes for meals come in, I've used the api TheMealDB, linked below, to help bring my site to life.

## Features
There are three main features to the site. You can click on the "Categories", "Searchbar", and "Random" buttons to read more different sorts of food, search for ingrediants, countries where meals are from, or by names, or have a random meal come by if you're open to anything at the moment. When coming upon a recipe, you can read the ingrediants required, country of origin, category of the food, and sometimes, a link to Youtube to follow along with a cook.
